Title: Peak Matrix Processing and signal batch correction for metabolomics data sets
Version: 0.99.2
Author: Andris Jankevics and Ralf Weber
Maintainer: Andris Jankevics <a.jankevics@bham.ac.uk>
Description: Tools for scaling, normalisation and filtering of metabolomics data
   sets after raw data processing. Functionality includes: data filtering based
   on fraction of missing values across samples or features, blank sample filter
   and feature filter based on %RSD values using Quality Control (QC) samples.
   A unified user interface for several commonly used missing value imputation 
   algorithms is also provided. Supported methods are: k-nearest neighbours (knn),
   random forests (rf), Bayesian PCA missing value estimator (bpca), mean or 
   median value of the given feature and constant small value.
   Variance stabilising generalised logarithm transformation (glog) algorithm is
   implemented to help minimise contributions from unwanted technical variation. 
   Probabilistic quotient normalisation (PQN) and normalisation to total signal 
   intensity are also included.
   Additionally this package provides implementation of Quality Control-Robust 
   Spline Correction (QCRSC) signal batch effect correction method for mass 
   spectrometry data sets.
