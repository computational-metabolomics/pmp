Title: Peak Matrix Processing and signal batch correction for metabolomics datasets
Version: 1.3.0
Author: Andris Jankevics and Ralf Johannes Maria Weber

Description: Methods and tools for (pre-)processing of metabolomics datasets
    (i.e. peak matrices), including filtering, normalisation, missing value
    imputation, scaling, and signal drift and batch effect correction methods.
    Filtering methods are based on: the fraction of missing values (across
    samples or features); Relative Standard Deviation (RSD) calculated from the
    Quality Control (QC) samples; the blank samples. Normalisation methods
    include Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation (PQN) and normalisation to
    total signal intensity. A unified user interface for several commonly used
    missing value imputation algorithms is also provided. Supported methods
    are: k-nearest neighbours (knn), random forests (rf), Bayesian PCA missing
    value estimator (bpca), mean or median value of the given feature and a
    constant small value. The generalised logarithm (glog) transformation
    algorithm is available to stabilise the variance across low and high
    intensity mass spectral features. Finally, this package provides an
    implementation of the Quality Control-Robust Spline Correction (QCRSC)
    algorithm for signal drift and batch effect correction of mass
    spectrometry-based datasets.
